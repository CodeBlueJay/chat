second attempt for chat with nodejs. Probably cleaner. To start, make a codespace and use terminal there.
1. Install latest version of Nodejs.
```
nvm install node
```
2. Install necessary dependencies (Socket.io and Express).
```
npm install socket.io Express
```
3. Start the server.
```
node server.js
```
Done. Your welcome.
